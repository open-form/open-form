# About Artifacts

At the heart of OpenForm is the **artifact**.

An artifact is a structured definition of a document (or a collection of documents) that describes its origin, metadata, parties, fields, logic, and/or content(s).

OpenForm defines four artifact types:

| Artifact   | Description                                                                                                                         |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Document   | Static documents (e.g., disclosures, pamphlets)                                                                                    |
| Form       | Dynamic documents that have parties, fields, annexes, and/or logic (e.g., contracts, applications, certificates)                   |
| Checklist  | Compliance documents that track the completion of tasks or requirements (e.g., closing checklist)                                  |
| Bundle     | Containers for Documents, Forms, Checklists and even other Bundles (e.g., loan application packet)                                 |


Each type serves a different purpose, but all share the same foundational properties: they're typed, immutable, and machine-readable.

# Design Time vs Runtime

OpenForm draws a hard line between **design time** and **runtime**.

**Design time** is when you define artifacts—what fields exist, what rules apply, what layers are available. **Runtime** is when you use those definitions—fill fields, validate inputs, render outputs, collect signatures.

```ts
// Design time: define the form
const lease = open.form()
  .name("lease")
  .fields({
    tenant: { type: "text", required: true },
    rent: { type: "money", required: true },
  })
  .build()

// Runtime: fill and render
const filled = lease.fill({ fields: { tenant: "Jane Doe", rent: { amount: 1500, currency: "USD" } } })
const output = await filled.render({ renderer: pdfRenderer() })
```

Runtime never mutates the artifact. The definition remains stable while runtime operations execute against it.

# Immutability

Artifacts are **immutable**. Once defined, they don't change.

This enables versioning (artifacts can be stored, diffed, and audited), determinism (same artifact + same input = same output), and trust (downstream systems can rely on stable definitions).

Because artifacts are plain JSON, they integrate naturally with version control, compliance systems, and AI agents.

# Schema-Driven

Artifacts follow the OpenForm JSON Schema specification. This means:
- Artifacts can be validated with any JSON Schema validator
- Tooling can provide autocomplete and type checking
- AI agents can read the schema to generate valid artifacts or validate outputs

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://schemas.open-form.dev/schema.json",
  "kind": "form",
  "name": "residential-lease",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "fields": {
    "propertyAddress": { "type": "address", "required": true },
    "monthlyRent": { "type": "money", "required": true }
  }
}
```

You can author artifacts in JSON, YAML, or using the TypeScript SDK.
