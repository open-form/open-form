title: Registry
description: Publishing, distribution, and immutability

The registry is where artifacts are published and discovered. It's npm for documents.

## What the Registry Does

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Store** | Hosts published artifact versions |
| **Package** | Bundles artifact definitions with their layer sources |
| **Distribute** | Serves artifacts for install and runtime resolution |

## Publishing

When you publish an artifact, the registry packages the definition and all referenced layer sources.

```bash
openform publish
```

The CLI reads your artifact definitions, resolves all path references, and uploads the complete package.

## Slugs

A slug is the immutable identifier for a published artifact: `@org/repo/artifact@version`

| Segment | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `org` | The organization that owns the artifact |
| `repo` | The repository containing the artifact |
| `artifact` | The artifact name |
| `version` | The semantic version |

Examples:
```
@acme/forms/lease-agreement@1.0.0
@openform/irs/w9@2025.1.0
```

### Version Resolution

| Reference | Resolves To |
|-----------|-------------|
| `@acme/forms/lease-agreement@1.2.3` | Exact version |
| `@acme/forms/lease-agreement` | Latest stable release |

Explicit versions are recommended for production.

OpenForm does not support version ranges like `^1.0.0` or `~1.2.0`. Every reference resolves to exactly one version.

## Immutability

Once published, an artifact version never changes. `@acme/forms/lease-agreement@1.0.0` today is the same next month and next year.

If you need to change something, publish a new version.
