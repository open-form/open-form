description: When things happen — build time and run time
---

Everything in OpenForm happens in one of two phases: build time or run time.

## Two Phases

| Phase | What Happens |
|-------|--------------|
| **Build time** | Artifacts are authored and published |
| **Run time** | Artifacts are populated, validated, rendered, and assembled |

Build time is about definition. Run time is about execution.

## Build Time

Build time is when you author artifacts:

- Use primitives to define artifacts (Form, Document, Checklist, Bundle)
- Author layers for each artifact
- Test artifacts locally
- Version and publish to the registry

Artifacts live within repos. You work locally, then publish when ready.

```typescript
const leaseAgreement = open
  .form()
  .name("lease-agreement")
  .version("1.0.0")
  .fields({
    tenantName: { type: "text", required: true },
    monthlyRent: { type: "money", required: true },
  })
  .layers({
    html: {
      kind: "file",
      mimeType: "text/html",
      path: "fixtures/lease.html",
    },
  })
  .build();
```

## Run Time

Run time is when artifacts are used. Data flows in, outputs flow out. You select which layer to render for each use case.

### Population & Validation

Forms accept data and validate it against the schema:

```typescript
const filledLease = leaseAgreement.fill(leaseAgreementData);

if (!filledLease.isValid()) {
  console.error(filledLease.errors());
}
```

Required fields must be present, types must be correct, and constraints must be satisfied.

### Rendering

Rendering produces output in the selected layer format:

```typescript
const html = await filledLease.render({
  renderer: textRenderer,
  resolver,
  layer: "html",
});
```

### Compilation

Bundles assemble their member artifacts into a single package:

```typescript
const assembled = await leaseBundle.assemble({
  resolver,
  includeDocumentBytes: true,
});
```

Each content artifact is rendered, then everything is combined into the final bundle.
