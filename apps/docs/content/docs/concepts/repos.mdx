title: Repos & Resolution
description: Boundaries, paths, and environment-agnostic design
---

OpenForm is environment-agnostic. It runs in the browser, in Node, or in the cloud without assuming a filesystem. Repos define boundaries, and resolvers handle the environment.

## Repos

A repo is a versioned collection of artifacts and related files. Every OpenForm project lives in a repo.

```
my-repo/
├── lease-agreement.ts
├── fixtures/
│   ├── lease-agreement.html
│   └── lease-agreement.pdf
└── checklist.ts
```

### The Root

Every repo has a root. All paths are absolute from that root.

```
lease-agreement.ts
fixtures/lease-agreement.html
fixtures/lease-agreement.pdf
```

These are not filesystem paths — they're logical identifiers that the environment uses to locate content.

### Self-Contained

Layer sources must be in the same repo as the artifacts that reference them. You cannot reference a template in another repo.

This ensures artifacts are self-contained and publishing packages everything needed.

## Paths as Identifiers

Paths in OpenForm are logical, not physical. The path `fixtures/lease-agreement.pdf` is an identifier, not a filesystem location.

| Environment | What `fixtures/lease-agreement.pdf` Means |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Filesystem | `${repoRoot}/fixtures/lease-agreement.pdf` |
| Browser | `memoryMap.get('fixtures/lease-agreement.pdf')` |
| S3 | `s3.getObject({ key: 'fixtures/lease-agreement.pdf' })` |

Same path. Different resolution strategies.

## Resolution

Resolution is turning paths into content at runtime. Because OpenForm doesn't assume a filesystem, environments provide a resolver.

A resolver implements one method — how to read a path:

```typescript
interface Resolver {
  read(path: string): Promise<Uint8Array>
}
```

OpenForm ships with a filesystem resolver. You can define your own for other environments.

```typescript
import { createFsResolver } from "@open-form/resolvers/fs";
import { textRenderer } from "@open-form/sdk";

const resolver = createFsResolver({ root: "./my-repo" });

const filledForm = leaseAgreement.fill(data);
const output = await filledForm.render({
  renderer: textRenderer,
  resolver,
  layer: "pdf",
});
```

Swap resolvers, change environments. The artifact definition stays the same.
