An Attachment is a structured primitive that identifies a file. It is used at runtime to specify a [Form Annex](/schemas/artifacts/form/annex) that is attached to a [Form](/schemas/artifacts/form).

# Properties

<PropertiesTable properties={[
  {
    name: 'name',
    type: 'string',
    description: 'Original file name',
  },
  {
    name: 'mimeType',
    type: 'string',
    description: 'MIME type of the attached file',
  },
  {
    name: 'checksum',
    type: 'string',

    isOptional: true,
  },
]} />

# Examples

Attachments are stored as a record keyed by the annex identifier (the key from `form.annexes`):

```yaml tab="YAML"
annexes:
  government-id:
    name: drivers-license.pdf
    mimeType: application/pdf
    checksum: "sha256:e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855"

  proof-of-income:
    name: pay-stubs.pdf
    mimeType: application/pdf
```

```json tab="JSON"
{
  "annexes": {
    "government-id": {
      "name": "drivers-license.pdf",
      "mimeType": "application/pdf",
      "checksum": "sha256:e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855"
