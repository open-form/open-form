description: Complete reference for OpenForm data structures and types
---

This section provides the complete reference for all OpenForm data structures. The schemas define the shape of data used throughout the OpenForm ecosystem.

## JSON Schema

The complete OpenForm schema is published as a JSON Schema document conforming to [JSON Schema 2020-12](https://json-schema.org/specification).

| Schema | URL |
|--------|-----|
| Latest bundle | `https://schema.open-form.dev/schema.json` |
| Versioned bundle | `https://schema.open-form.dev/2026-01-01.json` |
| Individual items | `https://schema.open-form.dev/2026-01-01/form.json` |

Add the `$schema` property to enable editor validation and autocompletion:

```yaml
$schema: https://schema.open-form.dev/schema.json
kind: form
name: my-form
# ...
```
