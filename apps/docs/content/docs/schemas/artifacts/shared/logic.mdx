description: Named expressions and conditional logic
---

Logic types enable conditional behavior in forms and bundles. Named expressions can control field visibility, required status, and bundle content inclusion.

# LogicSection

A mapping of named logic expressions that can be referenced throughout an artifact.

```typescript
interface LogicSection {
  [key: string]: string
}
```

# CondExpr

A conditional expression that can be used in `include`, `required`, and `visible` fields.

```typescript
type CondExpr = boolean | string
```

When a string is provided, it can reference:
- Named expressions from the `logic` section
- Field values using `fields.<fieldName>.value`
- Comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`)
- Logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`)

# Examples

```yaml tab="YAML"
kind: form
name: loan-application
logic:
  isEmployed: "fields.employmentStatus.value == 'employed'"
  needsCoSigner: "fields.creditScore.value < 650"
  showIncomeFields: "isEmployed"

fields:
  employmentStatus:
    type: enum
    label: Employment Status
    enum: ["employed", "self-employed", "unemployed", "retired"]

  creditScore:
    type: number
    label: Credit Score
    min: 300
    max: 850

  employer:
    type: text
    label: Employer Name
    visible: showIncomeFields
    required: showIncomeFields

  monthlyIncome:
    type: money
    label: Monthly Income
    visible: showIncomeFields
    required: showIncomeFields

  coSignerName:
    type: person
    label: Co-Signer
    visible: needsCoSigner
    required: needsCoSigner
```
