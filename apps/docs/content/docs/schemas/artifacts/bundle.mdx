A Bundle is a recursive container for content artifacts. Bundles group together documents, forms, checklists, and other bundles into a single distributable unit.

For example, a loan application packet, new hire paperwork, or compliance submission.

| `logic` | `LogicSection` | No | Named logic expressions that can be referenced in include conditions |
| `contents` | `BundleContentItem[]` | Yes | Ordered list of bundle contents with keys |

## BundleContentItem
