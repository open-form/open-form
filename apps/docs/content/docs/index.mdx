# What is OpenForm?

[OpenForm](https://open-form.dev/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=docs) is a **documents as code** framework that lets **developers and AI agents** define, validate, and render business documents using typed, composable schemas.

- **For developers:** Eliminate template drift, scattered validation logic, and brittle glue code. Define documents once, enforce everywhere. Render to multiple targets.

- **For AI agents:** A structured document layer that LLMs can parse, validate, and generate against deterministically.

OpenForm is built for contracts, checklists, regulated filings, and other business documents—whether you're building traditional services or AI-powered workflows.
